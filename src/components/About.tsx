          <p>
            I was born in India, raised in South Africa, and now call Seattle home. My journey has been shaped by 
            <span className="text-foreground font-semibold"> Ubuntu </span>
            — the belief that "I am because we are."
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In 2021, I lost my father. That moment taught me that life is fragile, but purpose is forever. 
            I channeled my grief into coding — determined to build technology that uplifts others the way 
            I once wished to be uplifted.
          </p>

          <p>
            Growing up, I poured my heart into cricket, playing at both provincial and club level alongside professional athletes. 
            The sport taught me focus, teamwork, and the mental toughness to perform under pressure — qualities I now bring into 
            every project I build. My passion for fitness and strength training keeps me grounded; I believe discipline in the gym 
            mirrors discipline in life and engineering.
          </p>

          <p>
            At an all-boys school in Johannesburg, I learned humility and leadership, graduating in the 
            <span className="text-foreground font-semibold"> top 1% of students in South Africa</span>. 
            I won the Breakthrough Junior Challenge regional championship, earning recognition on national television. 
            But my real breakthrough was realizing that my skills could serve something greater than myself.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, at the University of Washington, I'm building 
            <span className="text-foreground font-semibold"> OuraNote </span>
            — an AI mental health journaling app — and Finderly, an AI DIY app for home repairs. 
            I've helped donate over 3,300 books and rescue 1,200+ animals through NGO websites I built.
          </p>

          <p className="text-foreground font-semibold text-xl pt-4">
            I don't just code. I create with compassion, discipline, and purpose.
